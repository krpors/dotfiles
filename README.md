Dotfiles, unscripted, plain and simple. Some reminders are described here, for
personal use. You may copy what you seem fit.

For the i3 window manager:

1. The config files are created for i3 4.13.
1. The `.gkt-2.0.rc` file contains theme settings for GTK 2 apps.
1. The `./config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` contains them for GTK 3 apps.
